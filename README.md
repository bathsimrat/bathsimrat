-  👋 Hi, I’m @bathsimrat

🎭 As an entrepreneur with a passion for the arts, I find joy in merging the creative and the analytical. I believe in the power of creativity to transform businesses and strive to incorporate elements of innovation in everything I do. 

📝 I’m a poet, finding beauty in words and expression. I consider code as another form of poetry, each line elegantly constructed to bring ideas to life. As a programmer, my aim is to write code that's as beautiful and profound as any poem.

🎵 Music runs through my veins, providing a rhythm to my life. As a musician, I understand the importance of harmony and rhythm - something I try to replicate in my coding projects. 

🎨 My journey as an artist has taught me to appreciate the aesthetics in everything. Designing interfaces and experiences that are both intuitive and pleasing to the eye is what I aspire for as a designer.

🎡 Above all, I am a fun-loving free spirit, always eager to learn, explore, and create. I find joy in the process of creation, whether it's building a new app, composing a song, or sketching a portrait.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript frameworks and exploring how they can be used to create more dynamic and interactive experiences. I'm also diving deeper into the world of UI/UX design, and how it can enhance the human-computer interaction.
